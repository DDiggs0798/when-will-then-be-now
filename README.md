# When Will Then Be Now

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the date filtering is not working properly thus causing the tests to fail. Your task is to rework this function so that it works as expected, making the tests pass.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**logFilter.js** - this file contains the functions for filtering of log messages based on the environment and date provided by the user

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**tests/logs.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically example log entries

**tests/tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `logFilter` module

## Exercise Submission

You should fork this repository and submit your working changes in a pull request to your forked repo.
